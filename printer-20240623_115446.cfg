[include mainsail.cfg]


# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH Manta M8P V1.0
# To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32G0B1 with a "8KiB bootloader" and USB communication.

# This config is currently only correct for V1.0 boards
# 
# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
